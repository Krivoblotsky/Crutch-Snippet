# Crutch-Snippet
The ASCII Crutch codesnippet for XCode. For those who really needs.
You will never forget to fix some bad things, quick workarounds, or code that smells, just mark it with a crutch.

```objc
    // .___.
    // |   |
    // |   |
    // |___|
    // |   |
    // |   |
    //  \ /
    //   |
    //   |
    //   |
    //   i
```

### How it works

Just start typing "crutch" at any code place.
